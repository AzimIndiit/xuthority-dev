const handleFollowersClick = () => {
  setActiveTab('followers');
  setFollowTab('followers');
};

const handleFollowingClick = () => {
  setActiveTab('following');
  setFollowTab('following');
};
```

### **Props Flow**
```
Profile → ProfileLayout → ProfileSidebar
```

### **CSS Classes Used**
```css
/* Hover effects for clickable counts */
hover:bg-gray-50 hover:scale-105 rounded-lg p-2 transition-all duration-200 cursor-pointer group
group-hover:text-blue-600
group-hover:text-blue-500
```

## ✨ **Result**

Now when users view their profile, they can:
1. **See their follower/following counts** (as before)
2. **Click on these counts** to view the detailed lists
3. **Experience smooth animations** and visual feedback
4. **Seamlessly manage their connections** without page navigation

The feature integrates perfectly with the existing FollowersFollowing component and maintains the same UI design language throughout the application! 🎉
