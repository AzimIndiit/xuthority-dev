## Future Enhancements
- Create dedicated compare page (`/compare`) ✅ Completed
- Add comparison table with feature-by-feature breakdown ✅ Completed
- Allow saving comparison results
- Add share comparison functionality
- Mobile-responsive comparison view ✅ Completed
- Drag and drop to reorder products in comparison

## API Requirements
The compare page will need to fetch:

6. Hover interactions on product logos (desktop)
7. Animation smoothness during add/remove
8. Mobile responsiveness across different screen sizes
9. Touch interactions on mobile devices
