# Remove Follower Functionality Fix

## Issue
The remove follower functionality was not working due to missing `currentUserId` prop being passed to the `FollowersFollowing` component.

## Root Cause
The `FollowersFollowing` component requires both `userId` (profile owner) and `currentUserId` (authenticated user) props to determine if the current user can remove followers. Without `currentUserId`, the component couldn't verify that the authenticated user is the profile owner.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `FollowersPage.tsx`
- **File**: `src/pages/user/FollowersPage.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `currentUserId={currentUser?._id}` prop to the `FollowersFollowing` component
- **Line**: 81

### 2. Fixed `Profile.tsx`
- **File**: `src/pages/user/Profile.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added `currentUserId={user._id}` prop to both `FollowersFollowing` component usages
- **Lines**: 253, 268

### 3. Enhanced `FollowersFollowing.tsx`
- **File**: `src/components/user/FollowersFollowing.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added better error handling and console logging in `handleRemoveFollower`
  - Fixed duplicate remove buttons by cleaning up the JSX structure
  - Added debug logging to show component props
  - Improved consistency between followers and following tabs

### 4. Cleaned up `useFollow.ts`
- **File**: `src/hooks/useFollow.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed duplicate success/error toasts from `useRemoveFollower` hook
  - Toasts are now handled only in the component level

## Backend Implementation
The backend already had the correct implementation:
- **API Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/v1/follow/followers/:userId/remove`
- **Controller**: `followController.removeFollower`
- **Service**: `followService.removeFollower`
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT token)

## Testing
1. **Start both servers**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd xuthority-dev && npm run dev
   
   # Backend
   cd xuthority-dev-backend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Steps**:
   - Login as a user
   - Go to your profile `/profile/followers`
   - You should see "Remove" buttons for your followers
   - Click "Remove" - it should work now
   - Check console for debug logs showing correct props

## Console Logs for Debugging
The component now logs the following for debugging:
- `FollowersFollowing props:` - Shows userId, currentUserId, activeTab, showRemoveButton
- `Cannot remove follower: currentUserId: X, userId: Y` - Shows when removal is blocked
- `Removing follower: X` - Shows when removal is attempted
- `Error removing follower:` - Shows any errors during removal

## Key Changes Summary
1. ✅ Added missing `currentUserId` prop to all `FollowersFollowing` usages
2. ✅ Fixed duplicate remove buttons in the UI
3. ✅ Enhanced error handling and debugging
4. ✅ Cleaned up duplicate toast messages
5. ✅ Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

The remove follower functionality should now work correctly!
